1.07  2003-06-10

- Set INSTALLDIRS=perl in Makefile.PL, as suggested by Michael
Schwern, who heard it from Sergio Brandano.


1.06  2003-06-04

- A bug in the handling of negative offsets from UTC could lead to the
return of invalid times during a DST transition.  This is from a patch
by Dave Mitchell currently in bleadperl.  See
http://bugs6.perl.org/rt2/Ticket/Display.html?id=19393 for details.
Thanks to Rafael Garcia-Suarez for pointing this out to me.

- Updated the AUTHORS section to include the actual authors.  Thanks
to Graham Barr for telling me who there are.

- Added SUPPORT section which tells people to use bugs.perl.org or
perlbug, since I read p5p and I want to make sure that the core and
this code stay in sync.

- Clarified docs to say that dates before the system's epoch may or
may not work, because POSIX only requires support for positive time_t
values.


1.05  2003-06-03

This version is nearly identical to version 1.04, which is included in
the Perl core, but it removes the use of "our" in order to make the
code backwards compatible with Perl 5.00503.  It probably works with
earlier versions of Perl as well, but I don't have anything earlier
than 5.00503 installed.

Changes made from the core version include:

- Packaged for distribution on CPAN.

- Added an AUTHOR section to the docs.

- Clarified some points in the docs, particularly the fact that this
module uses the local system's epoch, not the Unix epoch, contrary to
what the documentation suggests.

- Disabled tests for timelocal.pl Perl4 library since it's not
included in standalone distribution.
